    1. Compare if a is greater than b
    2. Compare if a is less than b
    3. Compare if a is equal to b

### Challenge2: Ordered Count of Characters ###

## BDD
    1. create an empty array and shovel the values of a into the empty array
    2. map through the array and use chars to turn a into independent characters/ values
    3. loop through the array and use bubble-sort to put identical elements side by side
    4. create a new hash 
    5. iterate through the sorted array
    6.count the number of identical elements and place them into the new hash
    7.turn the hash into an array
